# SageMaker Deployment Project

This is the final project I've built in Udacity **Deep Learning Nanodegree**.

A lot of this readme is taken exactly from the project description made by Udacity and I have just made small modifications to their description and put it in this readme.

The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker.

I have used the IMDB dataset, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker to make this project.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
