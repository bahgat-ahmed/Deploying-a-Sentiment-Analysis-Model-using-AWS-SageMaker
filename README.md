# SageMaker Deployment Project

This is the final project I've built in Udacity **Deep Learning Nanodegree**.

A lot of this readme is taken exactly from the project description made by Udacity and I have just made small modifications to their description and put it in this readme.

## Project Overview
In this project I have constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I have created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I deployed this model and constructed a simple web app which interacted with the deployed model.

## Further Instructions

Other details are mentioned in the project Notebook.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook.
